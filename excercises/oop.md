**Beginner Exercises:**

- Create a class called Person with properties for name, age, and address. Implement methods for setting and getting these properties. Create a few instances of the Person class and display their information.

- Create a class called BankAccount with properties for account number, balance, and account holder name. Implement methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. Create a few instances of the BankAccount class and perform transactions on them.

- Create a class called Shape with an abstract method called CalculateArea(). Create subclasses for Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Implement the CalculateArea() method in each subclass to calculate the area of the respective shape.

- Create a class called Employee with properties for name, department, and salary. Implement methods for setting and getting these properties. Create subclasses for Manager, Engineer, and Salesperson. Implement additional properties and methods specific to each subclass.

- Create a class called Book with properties for title, author, genre, and number of pages. Implement methods for setting and getting these properties. Create a few instances of the Book class and display their information.

**Intermediate Exercises:**

- Create a class called Student that inherits from the Person class. Add additional properties for student ID, major, and GPA. Implement methods for setting and getting these properties.

- Create a class called Animal with properties for name, species, and age. Implement methods for making sounds and eating. Create subclasses for Dog, Cat, and Bird. Implement specific sounds and eating behaviors for each subclass.

- Create a class called Vehicle with properties for make, model, and year. Implement methods for starting the engine, accelerating, and braking. Create subclasses for Car, Truck, and Motorcycle. Implement specific behaviors for each subclass.

- Create a class called Product with properties for name, price, and quantity. Implement methods for adding and removing items from stock. Create a class called ShoppingCart that stores a collection of Product objects. Implement methods for adding, removing, and calculating the total cost of items in the shopping cart.

- Create a class called Account with properties for account holder name, account type, and balance. Implement methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. Create a class called ATM that allows users to perform transactions on their accounts.

**Advanced Exercises:**
